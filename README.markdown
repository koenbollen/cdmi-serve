About: CDMI-Serve
=================

The **CDMI-Serve** project was initially meant as a reference server for the
[CDMI][1] protocol. However, it seemed that with a bit more effort it could
easily become a basic but decent CDMI server for simply sharing data.

So, this project is aiming at a basic, simple yet complete CDMI server in
Python. It may not implement every last aspect of the protocol, but it will
support at least everything that can't be disabled using the capabilities.



Quickstart
==========

To run the server execute the following commands:

    $ git clone git://github.com/koenbollen/cdmi-serve.git
    $ cd cdmi-serve
    $ mkdir data
    $ python scripts/cdmi-serve data/
